To set up the frontend and backend 
1. Clone the repository using the command - git clone <repository-url>.
2. Navigate to the backend directory, run npm install to install dependencies, install mongodb and set up and start the server with node index.js.
3. Navigate to the frontend directory, run npm install, and start the frontend with npm run dev.
4. Verify everything works by accessing http://localhost:3000 in the browser. Ensure tools like Node.js, Git, and any required database (e.g., MongoDB) are installed.
